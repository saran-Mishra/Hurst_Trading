Systematic Trading utilizing ML and Hurst Exponents

# A pairs-trading strategy utilizing the Hurst Exponent
The Hurst exponent is a measure used to characterize the long-term memory of a time series data set. In pairs trading, 
the basic idea is to identify two assets that historically have exhibited a high degree of correlation in their price movements.
The strategy involves taking long and short positions on the two assets with the expectation that any divergence from their historical
correlation will eventually revert to the mean, resulting in a profitable trade.

The Hurst exponent can be applied to the price series of the two assets in a pairs-trading strategy to gain insights into the 
potential mean-reverting behavior and the persistence of trends. The value of the Hurst exponent can help determine the strength and duration
of the autocorrelation in the price series.
